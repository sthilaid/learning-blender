    <h3>Blender Guru Donut</h3>
    <p>
      First tutorial I did to learn blender was Blender 2.8 Guru's donut
    tutorial
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U">link</a>). I
    didn't finish the whole series but here where I was at when I stopped.

I think it's a very good and fun class. It's very thourough and fun to do. The forums for the classes on gamedev.net are also very fun and useful. Here are the renders I've got for that class.</p>

    <h3>GameDev.net weekly challenges</h3>
    <h4>May 4th, 2020 Challenge: Party</h4>
    <p>
      Here is my scene for the "Party" themed challenge. I decided to translate
    that into a "board game party" and made a scene from
    the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root">Root</a> board
    game which I really like. The scene inspiration was taking
    from <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9b8232t">here</a>. Rendered using cycles at 128 samples.
